Last three months have been intense.

1. I announced on LinkedIn that [I was closing my company](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/juangcarmona_i-quit-at-the-end-of-summer-2017-i-built-activity-7366495383784501249-y7CD).

3. Then I wrote that I was done [chasing the administrative circus that comes with entrepreneurship in Spain](https://jgcarmona.com/cierre-jgcarmona-consulting/).

5. Last week, [I said I was joining a company I admire](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/juangcarmona_%F0%9D%90%8D%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B1%F0%9D%90%AD-%F0%9D%90%8C%F0%9D%90%A8%F0%9D%90%A7%F0%9D%90%9D%F0%9D%90%9A%F0%9D%90%B2-%F0%9D%90%88-%F0%9D%90%AC%F0%9D%90%AD%F0%9D%90%9A%F0%9D%90%AB%F0%9D%90%AD-%F0%9D%90%9A-%F0%9D%90%A7-activity-7396222413547540480-mTS5), but I couldn't yet name

The last twelve weeks were the opposite of simple: applications, automated rejections, interviews, technical exercises, conversations, offers, counteroffers... and adding the bureaucratic nightmare of liquidating a business.

> Spanish `burro-crazy` remains undefeated.

My target was clear: Software Engineering in the right context. So, I did what I always do: research. _They_ were already on my radar. Everything I checked pointed in the same direction: talented people, engineering culture, values aligned with mine, innovation, cross-disciplinary teams, transparency, sustainability driven, reputation and a portfolio that proves execution.  
  
So, my first application was to **Plain Concepts**. Only after that I applied to every AI-related remote position out there. During the first weeks I received more than fifty automated rejections. Then I “hacked” my CV: removed old experiences and made it ATS-friendly. And then interviews started to knock my door. I did many, way too many. In a few processes, after the fourth interview, even with the “big boss”, I was told they were afraid I’d leave in a few months. Fine. Frustrating but fine...

Then Plain Concepts called. The first contact was friendly. I started their process, which was really enjoyable, and now I can finally say it:

That’s what I wanted, and that’s what I achieved. No more losing hours with Digital Kits or taxes, dealing with institutions, battling against forms, and being buried with business overhead that added nothing but headaches. Nobody can wear so many hats without burning out.

Even after announcing I was stepping away, people kept calling me for coaching services and small engagements... And I had to say no. I helped a couple of people for free, but that phase is over. Focus demands cutting ties.

Now I need to simplify my site, remove old service pages, kill corporate leftovers, and accelerate the shutdown. Liquidating the company remains slow and expensive. Bureaucracy in Spain is forced labor disguised as procedure. That’s precisely why I’m done with it. I want to spend time building systems, not fighting systems.

I’ll keep writing about software architecture and edge tech: Aspire, MAF, DMR, MCP, agentic patterns, infra, and my side project, Sentra Brain. That doesn’t change.

New chapter. Back to engineering.
