## 🌍 **Revolutionizing the IT Market with Open Source**

The IT job market has radically changed over the past decade. The rise of remote work, freelance platforms, and AI is redefining how companies and professionals connect. However, in this new paradigm, fundamental issues persist: **lack of transparency, excessive commissions, and difficulty finding the right talent**.

**The Full-Stack Team (TFST)** is an **open-source freelance platform** that was created as a response to these challenges. A **transparent and collaborative open-source project**, TFST aims to redefine how companies and IT professionals connect by integrating **smart contracts, verified reputations, and a sustainable model**.
